#### üîã Power Management Module

The power management module distributes the battery energy, after buck regulator filtering, to the modules of Raspberry Pi, motor driver, sensors (IMU, Lidar, encoder), power system (BLDC motor, servo), etc., to ensure the power supply of each module operates stably.

- **Battery Management System (BMS)**
  - Uses **24V 3000mAh Li-ion battery pack** (XT60 interface) as the main power source.
    - 29.4V 2A charger
  - Built-in intelligent protection board for stable output and longer life:
  - Overcurrent protection: prevents the battery from discharging too much current
  - Short-circuit protection: the product is automatically protected in the event of a short-circuit
  - Over-voltage protection: prevents the battery from charging and discharging too high a voltage
  - Over-charging protection: prevents the battery from being over-charged
  - Over-discharging protection: prevents the battery from being over-discharged
  - Anti-backlash protection: stops the work automatically in case of reverse plugging
  - 10A Button Switch (main switch: for controlling battery charging/discharging; emergency disconnecting the battery) + 16AWG conductor
  - Soldering part is covered with insulating green oil + Heat-shrinkable tubing/insulation tape is used for connecting part of the conductor

- **Voltage Conversion**
  - **Two-stage Bucking Architecture**:
  - Power Supply 24V: Power supply the BLDC motors, BUCK step-down circuits, power supply voltage acquisition circuits, and other modules directly through the power MOS.
    - First stage: TPS54160 (24V‚Üí12V, power supply dissipative resistor; 24V‚Üí5V: power supply servo, Raspberry, LDO) (Output current 1.5A, switching peak limiting current 1.7~2.3A)
  - TPS54160 Configuration Reference [Texas Instruments Official Design Tools](https://www.ti.com.cn/ product/cn/TPS54160#tech-docs)
  - Stage 2: RT9193 (5V‚Üí3.3V, LDO linear regulator, VCC, power supply MCU, encoder chip, motor driver chip), LP5907 (3.3V‚Üí5V, voltage regulator, AVCC, power supply analogue end temperature sampling)
  - **Decoupling filter network**: 10 √ó 1812 ceramic capacitors (50V/47¬µF) + 1812 ceramic capacitors (63V/47¬µF)
  - Changing the capacitor closest to the TVS diode to 63V/47¬µF prevents the capacitor from breaking down due to the surge phenomenon during power-up.
  - **Isolated Ground** - The analogue/power ground is isolated from the digital ground to avoid signal interference.

- **Circuit Protection Design**
  - **Overcurrent Protection**: FSMD012 self-resetting fuse (48V/40A)
  - **Temperature Monitoring**: 10kohm NCP18XH103F0 thermistor (B-value -25‚ÑÉ/100‚ÑÉ-3455K)
  - **Reverse Connection Protection**: SS34 Schottky diode (40V/3A)
  - **Soft Start Protection **: TPS54160 soft-start setting pin external 6.8n capacitor (the larger the capacitance value, the slower the startup)
  - **Transient Suppression**: SMAJ26CA (reverse cutoff voltage (Vrwm): 26V; clamp voltage: 42.1V; peak pulse current (Ipp): 9.5A), bypass resistor (10Œ©)
  - Previously used SMAJ30CA with clamp voltage was about 48.4V, the inrush current was so high that the voltage instantaneously rose above the capacitor breakdown voltage before the TVS reacted, causing the capacitor nearest the TVS to break down. (Battery output voltage is 24V~29V)
  - Previously used 3.3Œ© resistor with limited inrush suppression
  - **LM5109B** High Speed Half Bridge Driver + **RTP50W** 2Œ©/50W Dissipative Resistor to improve motor system stability.
    - Without power dissipation resistors, excess power is charged back to the supply during deceleration to achieve the desired deceleration torque. If the power supply is not able to absorb this energy (which is usually the case with battery power), the bus voltage will inevitably rise. This may cause damage to the switching power supply. In this design, although battery power is used, RTP50W dissipative resistors are still used to improve the stability of the motor system.
    - The power selection of the power resistor depends on your configuration of the motor and the peak power or average deceleration power generated when the motor decelerates. To be safe, you need to consider the speed of the motor and the current the motor can handle. When braking at maximum speed and maximum motor current, the power dissipated in the power dissipation resistor can be calculated as: P_brake = V_emf * I_motor where V_emf = motor_rpm / motor_kv. In this design, using a PM3510 motor with 1250rpm 45rmp/v 0.93A, P_brake = 1250 / 45 * 0.53 = 25.83W.

  </div>

  - **Technical Principles and Architecture** 
    - The AS5147P utilizes an array of **Hall effect sensors** that convert magnetic field components into voltage signals by sensing the magnetic flux density perpendicular to the chip surface. After amplification and filtering by an analog front end (AFE), these signals are fed into an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and then processed by the CORDIC algorithm to accurately calculate the angle and amplitude of the magnetic vector. In addition, the AS5147P 
      - **Automatic Gain Control (AGC)** mechanism: real-time adjustment of the front-end gain to adapt to changes in magnetic field and temperature 
      - **CORDIC Algorithm Module**: calculates the angle of rotation and the amplitude of the magnetic field 
      - **Interpolation Mechanism**: completes the missing pulse of the ABI at high speeds to ensure the continuity of the output signals 
    - The AS5147P has a **Dynamic Angular Error Compensation (DAEC‚Ñ¢)** function. The AS5147P features **Dynamic Angle Error Compensation (DAEC‚Ñ¢)**, which improves real-time performance of the SPI, ABI, and UVW outputs by estimating the time delay during angle measurements and predicting and compensating for the angular output error accordingly. This compensation is particularly effective at constant speeds.


##### **YDLIDAR X3 LIDAR** 

The YDLIDAR X3 is a high-performance, compact 2D LiDAR (LiDAR) product that utilizes the principle of triangulation and combines advanced optical, electrical and algorithmic design to enable **360-degree omni-directional environmental scanning and high-precision distance measurement**.

- üåê Core Functions Overview 
  - üîÑ **360¬∞ Omni-directional Scanning and Distance Measurement** 
  YDLIDAR X3 is equipped with a rotary motor, which is capable of realizing **complete 360-degree rotations in the horizontal plane**, and real-time outputting the distance measurement data of the corresponding angle in each rotation to form a high-density 2D point cloud map. This means that it is capable of **panoramic perception of its surroundings** and can obtain complete spatial information without moving the platform itself.
  - üéØ **High-precision and high-frequency ranging performance** 
  The radar achieves a ranging capability of up to **4,000 times per second** (typical) through the mechanism of transmitting high-frequency laser pulses and receiving them as echoes, ensuring smooth, detailed perception even in fast-moving environments.
    - **Typical ranging accuracy: ¬±2cm (‚â§1m)** 
    - **Relative error: minimum 1%, and within 3.5%~5% at long distances** 
  - ‚òÄÔ∏è **Strong resistance to interference from ambient light** 
  The YDLIDAR X3 possesses good resistance to interference, and can work stably under natural light or artificial light. Whether it is bright daylight exposure or indoor lighting strobe, it can maintain stable output to ensure the reliability of ranging data.
  - üîã **Low power consumption, small size, long life** 
  The product design focuses on energy saving and portability, with low energy consumption operating characteristics, and adopts a long-life rotating structure and optoelectronic components, which is suitable for long-term deployment in a variety of smart devices.
  - ‚öôÔ∏è **Motor speed is adjustable to suit different needs** 
  Users can adjust the scanning frequency from **5Hz to 10Hz** according to the application needs, balancing the measurement accuracy and real-time performance. For example: 
    - **5Hz: the angular resolution can be up to 0.6¬∞**, suitable for scenarios requiring high accuracy (e.g. map building) 
    - **10Hz: the angular resolution is 1.2¬∞**, which is more suitable for tasks requiring higher real-time performance (e.g. obstacle avoidance)

    - **System monitoring threads**: such as temperature, voltage monitoring and fault detection.
    - **Motor status management thread**: periodic update of the operating status of each axis.
  - The main thread exits when the task is completed and the system enters the real-time operation state.

  - Note why the thread performs the control and uses a timer interrupt?


##### PID Regulation Flow - FOC Algorithm

The control algorithm uses a three-level closed-loop architecture with position control, speed control and current control in order from top to bottom. The control thread receives new input commands, reads the encoder and current sensor feedback, executes each level of the PID algorithm, and updates the control output in each control cycle. The entire process is embedded with measures such as anti-integral saturation, limiting, gain scheduling, and anti-groove calibration to ensure high accuracy and robustness.

- **Overall flow of the control chain**

    F --> G[Current Loop: access to the d-q coordinate system, control current error using the PI algorithm PI algorithm to control current error]
    G --> H[Voltage command calculated and converted by SVPWM module to generate PWM waveform]
  ```

  Of these:
  - **Input Processing** Updates the internal setpoint according to the different input modes (Passthrough, speed/torque ramping, trajectory planning, etc.) and filters the loop bandwidth, limits, etc.
  - **Position loop** In position control mode, only proportional feedback (pos_gain) is used in conjunction with loop drift correction, notch compensation, etc.
  - **Velocity loop** In addition to multiplying the velocity gain (vel_gain) to obtain a preliminary torque command, an integral term (vel_integrator_torque_) is introduced for error accumulation, and windproof control (gain scheduling and anti-saturation measures) is used.
  - The **current loop**, on the other hand, performs PI modulation of the d-q current error within the Field Oriented Control module, with the integral state limited by the saturation condition of the modulation vectors and combined with feed-forward terms (e.g., reverse potential, R/L feed-forward) to guarantee the system response.

- **Schematic of control chain operation**
  The interaction between the control thread and the peripherals and ADC/FOC interrupts can be summarised as:

  ```

  In this process:
  - **Input Processing**: not only includes direct setpoint transmission, but also includes various logics such as filtering, slope updating, Trap Traj interpolation, mirror mode, etc.
  - **Feedback from each link**: Position and speed errors affect low and medium frequency control respectively, while the current loop operates at higher frequencies to ensure timely response of the entire closed loop.
  - **Error protection and monitoring**: Sensor validity, limit status and power mismatch are constantly detected inside the control thread, and protection is triggered in case of abnormality (e.g. shutdown or error reporting).

- **Position loop** PID (slow closed loop)
  - **Inputs**: target position (pos_setpoint) vs. actual position (encoder / PLL or sensorless estimation).
  - **Outputs**: generation of a correction value for the target velocity (vel_setpoint).
  The position loop is often purely proportional (P-control), and should cycle the cyclic setpoints. In some modes, anti-groove calibration data is also superimposed on the error correction.

  ```cpp
  // Note: the actual code distinguishes between linear and cyclic setpoints,
  // and introduces both drift prevention and gain scheduling (which reduces the feedback gain when the error is small).
  float pos_error = pos_setpoint - pos_estimate;
  if(config_.circular_setpoints) {
      pos_error = wrap_pm(pos_error, pos_wrap_value);
  }
  vel_setpoint = vel_setpoint_base + config_.pos_gain * pos_error;
  ```

- **Speed loop** PID (medium speed closed loop)
  - **Inputs**: desired speed generated by the position loop (with position P compensation), actual speed (from encoder / PLL output).
  - **Output**: calculation to obtain a torque expectation, which is converted to represent the current (iq_setpoint).
    The implementation uses a PI control structure, where the integral term is protected against saturation (e.g. limiting or attenuation). The sample code concept is shown below:

  ```cpp
  float vel_error = vel_desired - vel_estimate;
  vel_integrator_torque_ += (vel_integrator_gain * vel_error * dt);
  vel_integrator_torque_ = std::clamp(vel_integrator_torque_, -config_.  vel_integrator_limit, config_.vel_integrator_limit);
  // Here it is also possible to combine gain scheduling: lowering the P-action at small errors (gain_scheduling_multiplier)
  float torque = torque_setpoint + (vel_gain * gain_scheduling_multiplier * vel_error) + vel_integrator_torque_;
  ```

  Among them:
  - **Input modes**: different modes (e.g. VEL_RAMP, TRAP_TRAJ, MIRROR, TUNING, etc.) determine how the pos_setpoint/vel_setpoint/torque_setpoint is updated;
  - **Limiting mechanism**: ensures that the system output does not exceed the safe range by limiting the torque and vel_ setpoint to ensure that the system output does not exceed the safe range;
  - **Error detection**: triggers an error condition immediately when, for example, overspeed error or spinout (electromechanical power mismatch) is detected.

- **Current loop** PID (FOC control, high speed closed loop)
  - **Inputs**: target current (iq_setpoint and (optionally) id_setpoint) and measured current (Iq, Id sampled by ADC and transformed by Clarke / Park).
  - **Output**: Voltage command in d-q coordinate system calculated by PI control (including feed-forward term), then converted to PWM waveform by inverse Park transform and SVPWM algorithm. The sample code concept is as follows:

  ```cpp
  // Take the Iq component as an example (Id generally holds or tracks a predetermined value, depending on the algorithm and motor type)
  float Ierr_q = iq_setpoint - iq_measured;
  v_current_control_integral_q_ += Ierr_q * (i_gain * dt);

  // If overmodulation is detected (output vector amplitude exceeds limits), the integration term is attenuated (protection against integration storms)
  float mod_scalefactor = /* Scaling factor calculated from current output modulus */;
  if (mod_scalefactor < 1.0f) {
      // Lockout or decay points
      v_current_control_integral_q_ *= 0.99f;
  }
  vq = Vq_feedforward + (p_gain * Ierr_q + v_current_control_integral_q_);
  ```

  This is followed by an inverse Park transform and SVPWM algorithm similar to the one below:

  ```cpp
  // Convert mod_d, mod_q in d-q coordinates to Œ±-Œ≤ coordinates.
  float c_p = cos(pwm_phase);
  float s_p = sin(pwm_phase);
  float mod_alpha = c_p * mod_d - s_p * mod_q;
  float mod_beta = c_p * mod_q + s_p * mod_d;

  // SVM module maps (mod_alpha, mod_beta) to PWM timings (tA, tB, tC)
  auto [tA, tB, tC, success] = SVM(mod_alpha, mod_beta);
  ```

  - Note: The current control state is used for feedforward and load prediction in the actual control, taking into account R/L and feedforward compensation of the reverse electromotive force, which is reflected in the code in Motor::update() and FieldOrientedController::get_alpha_beta_output().

  > **Additional Notes**:
  > - All the PID parameters for each link (e.g. pos_gain, vel_gain, vel_integrator_gain, current loop p_gain, i_gain, etc.) are loaded from the NVM during system initialisation, and parameter tuning directly affects closed-loop dynamics and stability.
  > - In addition, the input modes (e.g. TRAP_TRAJ for trajectory planning mode) and anticogging measures are also preprocessed at the setpoint before the PID control chain, thus ensuring smooth and robust control instructions.


##### Driver Development
- **Encoder (ASA5147P)**: supports multiple types including: SPI, ABI, UVW, PWM; this motor driver supports two modes:
  - ABZ mode: uses the encoder mode of the stm32F4 timer peripheral, reads the position and speed feedback from the motor encoder
  - SPI mode: directly reads the ASA5147P's registers with higher 14-bit precision
- **FLASH (W25Q32JVSSIQ)**: for storing parameters, configurations, etc.;
- **Motor Driver (DRV8301)**
  - SPI Initialisation, Configuration Chip
  - Using stm32F4 advanced timer TIM1 TIM8: for 3-phase motor drive, reducing EMI; Complementary PWM output with dead time configuration (force PWM to be 50% during count down) to prevent short-circuiting of the upper and lower bridge arms straight through
- **Servo Driver (SG995)**: PWM mode of TIM2 to control the servo's angle.


##### Communication protocols
- **USB CDC/HID** **CAN bus**
  - fibre stack: a set of application layer protocols used for communication between the upper and lower units. The corresponding communication protocol stack is generated according to the contents of the ymal file.
  - Data type: format of packet Format of stream
- **UART Serial port**: to communicate with external sensors or Raspberry Pi.
  - Serial communication protocol: UART 921600 8N1, ASCII format; sends motor position and speed information continuously at 100Hz.

##### Configuration Tool UI
- **Parameter Configuration Tool**
  - QT-based visualisation interface;
  - Visual parameter tuning: motor pole-pair number, encoder CPR, brake resistance settings ......;
  - One-click calibration: measurement of the motor's electrical characteristics (i.e., motor phase resistance and phase inductance), as well as encoder offset calibration;
  - Real-time monitoring : Voltage, current, temperature feedback.
  - **Note**: The platform brushless motor used in this project is
- **PID Configuration Tool**: further unleash the performance of the FOC driver board. By adjusting the PID parameters, the controller can quickly respond to disturbances or changes in the system (e.g., applied external forces or changes in setpoints) without becoming unstable, which ensures that the motor driver board is able to control the motor in the most efficient way.
  - QT-based visualisation interface;
  - Real-time monitoring: position and speed feedback;
  - Sliders: visual adjustment of the PID parameters;
  - **Experience**: first set the Ki of the speed loop to 0 and the Kp of the position loop to a relatively small value. Gradually increase the Kp of the velocity loop by about 30% per iteration until the motor vibrates. In reality, as Kp increases, the current sound gets louder and louder and eventually vibrates at high frequency. Back off the Kp of the velocity loop to 50% of the vibration value and then set the integrator to 0.5 * bandwidth * vel_gain, where bandwidth is the total tracking bandwidth of the system. For this project, bandwidth was 10 hz. set the Ki of the velocity loop = 0.5 * 10 * vel_gain according to the formula. subsequently, gradually turn up the position loop Kp until some overshoot is seen. Back off the position loop Kp until there is no more overshoot. Debugging can be done by giving a Kp and then a position target to see the step response.
  - **Note**: Tests have found that the magnitude of the current sound has nothing to do with the Kp of the position loop, and everything to do with the Kp of the velocity loop; reduce the velocity loop Kp, and the current sound will be much smaller. It is reasonable to say that the larger the Kp of the position loop, the more overshoot, but actually found that the Kp is relatively small, the motor is very soft, at this time instead of overshoot. I feel that because the motor is too soft at this time, to the target position is a little out of control.

    - **TF Publishing**: `publish_odom_tf` is set to `true` to make sure the `odom` ‚Üí `base_link` coordinate transformation is working.
  - **2. Joint state publishing plugin (`joint_state`)**: publish left and right wheel joint states to `/joint_states`.
    - **Update frequency**: `30 Hz`, consistent with the differential drive plugin, reasonable.
    - **Joint names**: correctly associate `left_wheel_joint` and `right_wheel_joint`, matches URDF.
    - **TF Publishing**: robot_state_publisher node runtime publishes coordinate transformations for `base_link` ‚Üí `left_wheel_link` and `base_link` ‚Üí `right_wheel_link`.
  - **3. IMU Sensor Plugin**: configures IMU sensors and publishes IMU data.
    - **Noise model**: add Gaussian noise for both angular velocity and linear acceleration to match the real IMU characteristics.
      - **Angular velocity noise**: standard deviation `2e-4 rad/s`, slight jitter, reasonable.
      - **Linear acceleration noise**: standard deviation `0.017 m/s¬≤`, deviation mean `0.1 m/s¬≤`, simulated zero-bias drift, consistent with low-cost IMU characteristics.

- **Cartographer + Navigation2**: Realize map building and navigation path planning.
  - Map building: **Cartographer**;
    - Introduction: Cartographer is an open source real-time SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Map Building) system developed by Google, which supports map building in both 2D and 3D environments. It realizes high-precision and low-drift real-time map building by fusing multi-sensor data (e.g. LIDAR, IMU, odometer, etc.), which is widely used in robotics, autonomous driving and other fields.
    - Principle:
      1. **Front-end Scanning Matching**: Using local submaps (Submaps) construction, the robot position is estimated by matching real-time LiDAR data with submaps.
      2. **Backend Optimization**: eliminates cumulative errors using Loop Closure and Global Optimization (SLAM framework based on graph optimization).
      3. **Multi-sensor fusion**: combines data from IMU, odometer, etc. to improve the robustness of position estimation.
    - Advantages:
      - **Efficient real-time**: supports real-time graph building, suitable for dynamic environment applications.
      - **Multi-sensor support**: Flexible fusion of LIDAR, IMU and other data to adapt to complex scenes.
      - **Strong closed-loop detection**: Significantly reduces cumulative errors in long-term operation and improves the global consistency of the map.
      - **Open source and scalable**: clear code structure, support 2D/3D map building, active community.
    - Disadvantages:
      - **Complicated configuration**: parameter tuning relies on experience and needs to be optimized for different sensors and environments.
      - **High computational resource requirements**: high hardware requirements for 3D mapping or large-scale scenes.
      - **Limited dynamic environment processing**: mainly designed for static environments, dynamic obstacles may affect the accuracy of map building.
    - [Configuration](Software\ROS\wheel_robot\src\carto\config\carto.lua):

  - Navigation Path Planning: **Navigation2**;
    - Introduction: Navigation2 is the official navigation framework in ROS 2, used for path planning and autonomous navigation of mobile robots. It supports global path planning, local obstacle avoidance, recovery behavior, etc. It is suitable for wheeled robots, service robots and other scenarios.
    - Principle:
      1. **Global Planning**: Generate the global optimal path based on Costmap and algorithms (e.g., A*, Dijkstra).
      2. **Local Planning**: Combine with Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) or Timed Elastic Band (TEB) algorithm to avoid obstacles and track the path in real time. 3.
      3. **Behavior Tree Control**: manages navigation states (e.g., replanning, recovery mode) through a Behavior Tree (BT).
    - Advantages:
      - **Modular design**: plug-in architecture supports customization of algorithms (e.g., changing planners or controllers).
      - **Dynamic environment adaptation**: real-time updating of the cost map to effectively deal with dynamic obstacles.
      - **Cross-platform compatibility**: Based on ROS 2, supports multiple robot hardware and simulation environments.
      - **Behavior Tree Management**: Flexible handling of complex navigation logic (e.g. fault recovery, multi-target switching).
    - Disadvantages:
      - **Real-time limitations**: localized planning may be delayed in dense obstacles or complex terrain.
      - **Dependence on sensor quality**: localization (e.g. AMCL) and obstacle avoidance effects are highly affected by sensor accuracy.
      - **Complicated configuration**: fine tuning of parameters (e.g., velocity, acceleration) for robot dynamics is required.

##### üöó Physical Deployment and Control
After completing the SLAM simulation experiments, the chimera on the software has basically been completed, and the next step is to just replace the sensor data used in the simulation with the gazebo-generated sensor data used in the simulation to be replaced with the sensor data used in the physical object, and debug the control algorithm accordingly; then the control of the algorithm on the robot is transferred to the two wheels and servos through the communication protocol between the Raspberry Pi and the FOC driver.
